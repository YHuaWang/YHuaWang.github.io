I am a second-year doctoral student from the College of Plant Science and Technology at Huazhong Agricultural University. My research interests encompass computer vision, 3D reconstruction, image processing, and hyperspectral analysis, with a focus on studying the above-ground and root systems of plants.

I am fortunate to be advised by Professor Wanneng Yang and Associate Professor Ruifang Zhai at the Crop Phenotyping Center of Huazhong Agricultural University. I have completed 3D phenotyping research on the entire growth stages of tomatoes and am currently working on extracting 3D phenotypes for crops such as rice and rapeseed throughout their entire growth cycles.

You can find my previous research work at http://plantphenomics.hzau.edu.cn/journalism.
